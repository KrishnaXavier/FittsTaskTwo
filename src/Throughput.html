 <h3>Background</h3>
 
 Throughput is a commonly used as a dependent variable in experimental research on pointing
 devices or point-select techniques. However, in reviewing research papers where throughput is
 used, different methods of calculating Throughput are found. Because of this, it is difficult to
 compare results between research studies. Furthermore, it is often difficult to determine with
 certainty how throughput was calculated. This API and Java class seek to remedy these problems by
 (i) providing clear and simple instructions on how to calculate throughput and (ii) disseminating
 a tool to do the calculations. Measures related to throughput are also calculated and described,
 as noted below.
 <p>
 
 This is not a primer on Fitts' law or on Fitts' throughput. For background discussions, the
 reader is directed to the references cited at the end of this API. Let's begin.
 <p>
 
 Fitts' throughput is calculated on a sequence of trials. The premise for this is twofold:
 <p>
 
 <ol>
 <li>Throughput cannot be calculated on a single trial.
 <p>
 <li>A sequence of trials is the smallest set of user actions for which throughput can be
 calculated as a measure of performance.
 </ol>
 <p>
 
 (Note: A "sequence" is sometimes called a "block". The test conditions, including <i>A</i> and
 <i>W</i>, are the same for the entire sequence.)
 <p>
 
 On the first point, the calculation of Throughput includes the variability in selection
 coordinates. The variability is analogous to "noise" in the information-theoretic metaphor upon
 which Fitts' law is based. Thus, multiple selections are required and from the coordinates of
 selection, the variability in the coordinates is computed.
 <p>
 
 The second point is mostly of ecological concern. After performing a single sequence of trials,
 the user pauses, rests, stretches, adjusts the apparatus, has a sip of tea, adjusts her position
 on a chair, or something. There is a demarcation between sequences and for no particular purpose
 other than to provide a break or pause between sequences, or perhaps to change to a different
 test condition. It seems reasonable that once a sequence is over, it is over! Behaviours were
 observed and measured and the next sequence should be treated as a separate unit of action with
 separate performance measurements.
 <p>
 
 Related to the second point is the following: Throughput should not be calculated on larger sets
 of raw data. For example, if six participants each perform five sequences of trials under the
 same conditions, there are 6 &times; 5 &equals; 30 calculations of throughput, rather than a
 single calculation using the pooled data.
 <p>
 
 The <code>Throughput</code> code may be used in two ways: (i) as a class embedded in
 custom-designed software or (ii) as a utility program executed from a command prompt.
 <p>
 
 <!----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
 <b>Throughput Class</b>
 <p>
 
 As a class embedded in custom-designed software, the <code>Throughput</code> class file is placed
 in the same directory as other class files for the application. This API provides all the details
 necessary to use the <code>Throughput</code> class.
 <p>
 
 Use of this class begins with the instantiation of a <code>Throughput</code> object. The
 constructor receives the data necessary to characterise the sequence. The data consist of a
 String, two doubles, four arrays, and two integers. The arrays are all of the same size, with the
 size equal to the number of trials in the sequence. The data, or arguments, passed to the
 constructor are as follows:
 <p>
 
 <table border=1 cellspacing=0 width=80% align=center cellpadding=5>
 
 <tr bgcolor=#cccccc>
 <th>Argument

 <th>Description
 
 <tr>
 <td><code>code</code>
 <td><code>String

 This argument is used to associate test conditions (participant code, block code, device code,
 etc.) with the sequence. A null string may be passed if no code is necessary.

 <td>The specified ending coordinates for each trial (center of the "to" target)
 
 <tr>
 <td><code>select</code>
 <td><code>Point2D.Double[]
 <td>The coordinates of selection where each trial was terminated
 
 <tr>
 <td><code>mt</code>
 <td><code>double[]
 <td>The movement times (ms) for each trial
 
 <tr>
 <td><code>taskType</code>
 <td><code>int
 <td>A constant identifying if the task movements were one-dimensional (
 <code>Throughput.ONE_DIMENSIONAL</code>) or two-dimensional (
 <code>Throughput.TWO_DIMENSIONAL</code>)
 
 <tr>
 <td><code>responseType</code>
 <td><code>int
 <td> A constant identifying if the responses were serial (
 <code>Throughput.SERIAL</code>) or discrete (<code>Throughput.DISCRETE</code>). This variable is
 only used in calculating the effective target amplitude (see below).
 </table>
 <p>
 
 The <code>Throughput</code> class was designed to be "universal" &mdash; as general purpose as
 possible. It can be used both for serial and discrete tasks and for one-dimensional (1D) or
 two-dimensional (2D) movement. For serial tasks, each trial immediately follows the preceding
 trial. For discrete tasks, each trial includes a preparatory phase followed by a stimulus. Upon
 detecting the stimulus, the user performs the trial. The time between the arrival of the stimulus
 and the beginning of movement is called reaction time and is excluded from the movement time
 recorded for the trial.
 <p>
 
 The one-dimensional (1D) case is the traditional back-and-forth task used by Fitts in his
 original 1954 paper. The two-dimensional case is the task commonly used in accordance with the
 ISO 9241-9 standard (updated in 2012 as ISO/TC 9241-411). For two-dimensional movements, a series
 of targets are arranged around a layout circle. The trials proceed in a sequence. After each
 selection, the next selection is the target on the opposite side of the layout circle. Every
 second selection is beside a target previously selected, thus the movements progress around the
 layout circle until all targets are selected.
 <p>
 
 Throughput is calculated for each sequence of trials as
 <p>
 
 <blockquote> <i>TP</i> = <i>ID</i><sub>e</sub> / <i>MT</i> </blockquote>
 
 where
 
 <blockquote> <i>ID</i><sub>e</sub> = log<sub>2</sub>(<i>A</i><sub>e</sub> / <i>W</i><sub>e</sub>
 + 1) </blockquote>
 
 and
 
 <blockquote> <i>W</i><sub>e</sub> = 4.133 &times; <i>SD</i><sub>x</sub> </blockquote>
 
 <i>MT</i> is the mean movement time per trial (in seconds). <i>ID</i><sub>e</sub> is the
 effective index of difficulty (in bits). Throughput (<i>TP</i>) is the rate of information
 processing (in bits per second).
 <p>
 
 The subscript "e" beside <i>ID</i> is for "effective". In the effective form, the index of
 difficulty reflects the task the participant actually did rather than the task the participant
 was presented with.
 <p>
 
 The effective target width (<i>W</i><sub>e</sub>) is calculated from <i>SD</i><sub>x</sub>, which
 is the standard deviation in the selection coordinates for the sequence of trials. The selection
 coordinates are projected onto the task axis to maintain the inherent one-dimensionality of
 Fitts' law. The task axis is a line between the center of the desired start point ("from") and
 the desired end point ("to"). The projection is done using simple calculations involving the
 Pythagorean identity. Details are provide below and also in the source code.
 <p>
 
 The effective target amplitude, <i>A</i><sub>e</sub>, is the mean of the actual movement
 amplitudes over a sequence of trials. <i>A</i><sub>e</sub> is measured along the task axis.
 <p>
 
 The following figure illustrates the geometry for a single trial, including the point of
 selection:
 <p>
 
 <center> <img src="Throughput-1.jpg" width= 750> </center>
 <p>
 
 Although the figure shows a trial with horizontal movement to the right, the calculations are
 valid for movements in any direction or angle. Circular targets are shown to provide a conceptual
 visualization of the task. Other target shapes are possible, depending on the setup in the
 experiment. The calculation begins by computing the length of the sides connecting the
 <code>from</code>, <code>to</code>, and <code>select</code> points in the figure:
 <p>
 
 <blockquote><code>
 double a = Math.hypot(x1 - x2, y1 - y2);<br>
 double b = Math.hypot(x - x2, y - y2);<br>
 double c = Math.hypot(x1 - x, y1 - y);
 </blockquote></code>
 
 The <i>x-y</i> coordinates correspond to the <code>from</code>
 (<i>x</i><sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;<i>y</i><sub>1</sub>), <code>to</code>
 (<i>x</i><sub>2</sub>,&nbsp;<i>y</i><sub>2</sub>), and <code>select</code>
 (<i>x</i>,&nbsp;<i>y</i>) points in the figure. Given <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, and
 <code>c</code>, as above, <code>dx</code> is then calculated:
 <p>
 
 <blockquote><code>
 double dx = (c * c - b * b - a * a) / (2.0 * a);
 </blockquote></code>
 
 Note that <code>dx</code> is 0 for a selection at the center of the target (as projected on the
 task axis), positive for a selection on the far side of the center, and negative for a selection
 on the near side.
 <p>
 
 The effective target amplitude is simply <code>a + dx</code>. For serial tasks, an additional
 adjustment for <i>A</i><sub>e</sub> is to add <code>dx</code> from the previous trial (for all
 trials after the first). This is necessary since each trial begins at the selection point of the
 previous trial. For discrete tasks, the trial is assumed to begin at the center of the "from"
 target.
 <p>
 
 The use of the effective target amplitude (<i>A</i><sub>e</sub>) has little influence on
 throughput, provided selections are distributed about the center of the targets. However, it is
 important to use <i>A</i><sub>e</sub> to prevent “gaming the system.” For example, if all
 movements fall short and only traverse, say, ¾ of <i>A</i>, throughput is artificially inflated
 if calculated using <i>A</i>. Using <i>A</i><sub>e</sub> prevents this. This is part of the
 overall premise in using “effective” values: Participants get credit for what they actually did,
 not for what they were asked to do.
 <p>
 
 Once a throughput object is instantiated, throughput and related measures are retrieved using
 public instance methods. The most relevant methods are as follows:

 <b>Throughput Utility Program</b>
 <p>
 
 The <code>Throughput</code> class may be executed from a command prompt to process data in a
 file. The following is the usage message if executed without arguments:
 <p>
 
 <pre>
      PROMPT>java Throughput
      Usage: java Throughput datafile -t|-s
      
         where datafile = file containing data
               -t = table output
               -s = summary output (1 line per sequence)
 </pre>
 
 The first task in using <code>Throughput</code> as a utility is to organize the data in a file
 and in the correct format. The format is simple. As an example, the data for a sequence with 20
 trials are organized in 25 lines:
 <p>
 
 <pre>
      Line     Data (comment)
      1        Code header (String – once only)
      2        Code (String – once per sequence)
      3        A, W (2 doubles)
      4        Task type, Response type (2 String constants)
      5-24     From [x/y], To [x/y], Select [x/y], MT (7 doubles)
      25       Blank (next sequence begins on next line)
 </pre>
 
 Consider the file <code><a href="example-data.txt">example-data.txt</a></code>, which contains
 data formatted as above. The <code>Throughput</code> utility processes the data as follows
 (slightly abbreviated):
 <p>
 
 <pre>
      PROMPT>java Throughput example-data.txt -t
      Code = P07,B05,G03,C03
     A = 312.4, W = 130.2 (ID = 1.77)
     Task_type = 1D, Response_type = Serial

 The <code>–t</code> option is used to provide output in a tabular format (see above). The first
 part of the output simply echoes the input data in human readable form. After that, summary data
 available through the <code>Throughput</code> class are shown, culminating with the value of
 throughput (in bits per second).
 <p>
 
 As well as the values used in computing throughput, the <code>Throughput</code> utility provides
 information about the distribution of the selection coordinates, as projected on the task axis.
 This includes the skewness, kurtosis, and the results of a normality test. These data are useful
 if the research seeks to examine whether the selection coordinates form a Gaussian distribution,
 as assumed in the signal-and-noise model from which Fitts’ law emerged. The
 <code>Is_normal?</code> output is the result of a normality test. The null hypothesis is that the
 selection coordinates are normally distributed (<i>p</i> < .05). The Lilliefors test is used. If
 false is returned the null hypothesis is rejected, implying the distribution is not normal. If
 true is returned the null hypothesis is not rejected, implying the distribution has passed the
 test for normality.
 <p>
 
 The <code>Throughput</code> utility also outputs the number of misses in the sequence and the
 error rate (%). These data were not explicitly provided to the <code>Throughput</code> class.
 They are calculated based on the geometry of the trials, the task type, and the selection
 coordinates. The sequence of trials in the example above is from a target selection task using
 finger input on a touchscreen device. The outcome was <i>TP</i> = 7.94 bps. This value is higher
 than the <i>TP</i> typically reported for the mouse, which is generally in the 4 to 5 bps range.
 <p>
 
 The <code>–t</code> (table) option produces informative output; however, the organization is
 awkward if the analysis involves hundreds of sequences of trials, as typical in experimental
 research. For this, the <code>–s</code> (summary) option is more useful. With the <code>–s</code>
 option, the output is a rectangular, comma-delimited matrix with full-precision data. There is a
 header row followed by one summary row per sequence. The number of columns is <i>n</i> + 15,
 where <i>n</i> is the number of comma-delimited items in the code string (see the first two lines
 in <a href="example-data.txt"><code>example-data.txt</code></a>). The fifteen columns following
 the code columns contain the summary data, excluding the raw data. The header line identifies the
 data in each column.
 <p>
 
 The goal with the <code>–s</code> option is to provide output suitable for importing into a
 spreadsheet or statistics application where the real work of analysing the data begins. Here's an
 example for the data in <code><a href="example-data.txt">example-data.txt</a></code>:

 <p>
 
 Of course, this is just a simple example. For a complete experiment, the data are likely to span
 hundreds, perhaps thousands, of rows. With these, the task of summarizing and analysing the data
 begins.
 <p>
 
 Good luck. For comments or questions, please get in touch (<code>mack "at" cse.yorku.ca</code> ).

<div class="block">Returns deltaX for a trial. The geometry for a trial is defined by three points: from (center
 of the "from" target), to (center of the "to" target), and select (the selection coordinate).
 These are used in computing deltaX, which is the distance from the selection coordinate to
 the target center, as projected on the task axis.
 <p>
 
 NOTE: This calculation is correct, but a diagram helps to visualize the geometry. deltaX is
 negative for a selection on the "near side" of the target center (undershoot) and positive
 for a selection on the "far side" of the target center (overshoot). For a near-side
 selection, the a-b-c triangle is acute (i.e., a^2 + b^2 > c^2). For a far-side selection the
 a-b-c triangle is obtuse (i.e., a^2 + b^2 < c^2).

 NOTE: This method is defined as a static method so that is may be called by an application on
 a per-trial basis. Recall that instances of the Throughput class work with the data for the

 the "from" and "to" points) plus deltaX. See as well, getTrialDeltaX.
 <p>
 
 NOTE: The value of Ae calculated here assumes the trial started at the "from" coordinate. For
 serial responses, this may not be the case. An additional adjustment may be warranted for the
 beginning of the trial, such as adding deltaX from the previous trial (for all trials after
 the first trial in a sequence).
